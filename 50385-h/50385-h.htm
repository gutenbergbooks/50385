<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The lounge and winter garden of the Grand Babylon Hotel.
There are palms and flowers in profusion, and numbers of little
tables, surrounded each by two or three chairs. Several people are
seated, drinking coffee and liqueurs. At the back a flight of steps
leads to the restaurant, separated from the winter garden by a
leaded glass partition and swinging doors. In the restaurant a band
is playing.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Two or three waiters in uniform are standing about or serving
customers.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Ambrose Holland</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Wanley</span> <i>come out from the restaurant. He
is a well-dressed, elegant man of five and thirty. She is a
handsome widow of uncertain age.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pausing at the foot of the steps.</i>] Where shall we sit?<a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Let us choose a retired corner where we can gossip in peace.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! I didn’t come to the Grand Babylon in order to blush unseen. I
caught sight of a number of people during luncheon, who I’m quite
determined shall catch sight of me now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I was sufficiently gallant to have eyes for you only.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pointing to a table.</i>] Shall we sit there?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>D’you mind sitting on the other side? The waiter’s rather a pal of mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sitting down.</i>] What queer friends you have.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Waiter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">A Waiter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming forward.</i>] Your waiter will be here in one minute, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Wanley</span>.] You see, I’ve knocked about in so many places that I
have friends in every city in the world and every rank in life.<a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you saw the Parker-Jennings? They were sitting three tables
from us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Do you know that she cut me dead when I came in?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I’ve long told you that Mrs. Parker-Jennings is growing exclusive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear Ambrose, that she should have the impudence to cut me....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I respect her for it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I’m much obliged to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think it does much credit to her heart, but it certainly does to
her understanding. She has discovered that a title nowadays is not
nearly such a good passport to the world of fashion as she thought it
was. She knows you’re as poor as a church mouse, and she’s realised that
in Society the poor are quite rightly hated and despised by all who know
them.<a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but remember the circumstances. Five years ago the Parker-Jennings
didn’t know a soul in the world. They’d lived in Brixton all their
lives.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>It has been whispered to me that in those days they were known as Mr.
and Mrs. Bob Jennings&mdash;not nearly so smart, is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>He used to go to the City every morning with a black bag in one hand and
an umbrella in the other.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I wish that confounded waiter would come.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>One day an uncle in the North, from whom they vaguely had expectations,
died suddenly and left them nearly two millions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Some people are so lucky in the way they choose their uncles.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>He was a hardware manufacturer, and no one dreamt that he had a tenth
part of that fortune. I came across them in Switzerland and found they
were looking for a house.<a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>So, with a burst of hospitality, you asked them down to Taverner, and
they took it for twenty-one years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I introduced them to every one in the county. I gave little parties so
that they might meet people. And now, if you please, the woman cuts me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dryly.</i>] You have left out an essential detail in the account of your
relations with these good folk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Have I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] You have omitted to mention that when they took Taverner
they agreed to pay an exorbitant rent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>They could well afford it. Besides, it was a historic place. It was
worth whatever I could get for it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Parker-Jennings may be very vulgar, but he’s as shrewd a man as you’d
find anywhere between Park Lane and Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about.<a name="page_6" id="page_6"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Haven’t you? Well, then, I venture to suggest that if Mr.
Parker-Jennings gave you such an enormous rent for Taverner, it was on a
certain understanding. He was wise enough to find out that people can
live in Cheshire all their lives and never know a soul. I don’t suppose
he put it in the agreement between you, but unless I am very much
mistaken he took your place only on the condition that you should get
every one to call.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a brief pause.</i>] I was crippled with mortgages, and I had to
send my boys to Eton.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, I’m not blaming you. I only wish to point out that if you
introduced Mrs. Jennings to your friends, it was a matter of business
rather than of sentiment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little laugh.</i>] I suppose you think it’s very natural that she
should wish to kick away the ladder by which she climbed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>A</i> <span class="smcap">Waiter</span> <i>comes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Holland</span>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Waiter</span> (<span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>).</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Two coffees and two Benedictines. But you’re not my usual waiter.
Where’s Pierre?<a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Waiter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Blandly.</i>] He’s attending the funeral of an elderly female relative,
sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Holland</span> <i>looks up quickly, and then stares in a puzzled way</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I seem to know your face. Have I seen you anywhere?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Waiter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Mr. Ambrose Holland, I think.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Jack Straw! What on earth are you doing here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear fellow, it is possible to be no less of a philosopher in the
uniform of a waiter at the Grand Babylon Hotel than in the gown of a
professor at the University of Oxford.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] It’s really very odd that waiters should address you as my
dear fellow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>What an extraordinary encounter!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Please tell me who your friend is.<a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t the ghost of an idea.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>My dear Ambrose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I first met him in the States. I was in considerable financial
difficulties in those days&mdash;it’s three or four years ago now&mdash;and I got
a small part in a travelling company. Jack Straw was a member of it, and
we became great friends.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Is that his name?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>So he assures me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s very improbable, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Very. I believe Jack Straw was a highwayman, or something like that, and
he’s given his name to a public-house in Hampstead.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>He must be an extraordinary man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>He is. I don’t know whether I admire most his self-assurance or his
resourcefulness. I spent with<a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a> him the last two years before my ship
came home. We had some pretty rough times together, but he was a pillar
of strength. Difficulties seemed to arise only that he might surmount
them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>He sounds quite splendid.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>The worst of living with him was that you had no breathing-time. He’s a
man with an uncontrollable love of adventure. Prosperity bores him to
death, and time after time, when we’d managed to get out of rough water
into smooth, he’d throw up everything for some wild goose chase.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But who are his people?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Heaven only knows. I know he isn’t English, though he speaks it
wonderfully.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Is he by way of being a gentleman?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I can only tell you that he’s thoroughly at home in whatever society he
finds himself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I daresay that’s not a bad definition of a gentleman.<a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>He’s sailed before the mast, been a bar-tender in New York, and an
engine-driver on the Canadian Pacific. He’s been a miner up in the
Klondyke, and he’s worked on a ranch in Texas. And if he’s a waiter now,
I daresay he’ll be an organ-grinder next week, and a company-promoter
the week after. I’ve seen half a dozen fortunes within his grasp, and
he’s let them all slip through his fingers from sheer indifference to
money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Here he is with the coffee.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span> <i>comes in with coffee and liqueurs</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I should be overwhelmed with confusion at allowing you to wait on me, if
I did not feel certain that it appeals enormously to your sense of
humour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It has occurred to me that you will feel a natural hesitation about
giving me a tip. I may as well tell you at once that I shall feel none
about taking it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>It’s thoughtful of you to warn me. How much do I owe you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Two shillings the coffee and three shillings the liqueur. The prices
seem exorbitant to me, but I<a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a> suppose people must expect to pay for the
privilege of letting their friends see them at the best hotel in Europe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting down a coin.</i>] Don’t bother about the change.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Half a sovereign. My dear fellow, when you offer me a tip of five
shillings you are presuming unwarrantably on our former acquaintance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Helplessly.</i>] I’m sure I beg your pardon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I will keep one shilling as an adequate remuneration for my services and
return you four.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I am overpowered by your condescension.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Wanley</span>, <i>who has put a cigarette in her mouth</i>.] Light,
madam?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I should like to ask you to sit down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It would be eminently improper. Besides, I have other tables to attend
to. But I shall be delighted<a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a> to dine with you to-night if you have no
other engagement.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>It’s very kind of you. But will not your duties here detain you?... Mr.
Straw&mdash;Lady Wanley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bowing.</i>] How do you do. I’m only engaged here for the afternoon. Your

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I have often been impressed by the piety with which they bury their
maternal grandmothers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It appears that Pierre, an old acquaintance of mine, wished to attend
the funeral of a widowed aunt, the relic of an egg importer in Soho, and
a highly respectable person.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I can well imagine that nothing could be more respectable than to import
eggs to Soho.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>The head-waiter, who is an excellent fellow, with female relatives of
his own, promised to overlook his absence if he could find a substitute.
Pierre, like myself, is a person of somewhat striking physique and could
find no one able to wear his clothes. He<a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a> confided his distress to me,
and I, knowing that his uniform would fit me like a glove offered, at
once to step into the&mdash;breach.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I am relieved to hear that your appearance in this capacity is not due
to embarrassed circumstances.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I deplore the hastiness of your reasoning. My circumstances are
excessively embarrassed. Excuse me, I see some people who are proposing
to sit at one of my tables.</p>

<p>Yes, of course I do. How do you do, Lady Wanley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It makes me feel awfully grand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I adore them both, so you must like them. These dear things were waiting
to be married. Lewis was a curate in some dreadfully shabby suburb, and
he’s a saint.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Abbott.</span></p>

<p>I wish you wouldn’t say such absurd things about me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense. He’s a saint, but quite a modern nice sort of saint, who plays
cricket and doesn’t wear a hair shirt. And of course he couldn’t marry
Rosie, who hadn’t a penny to bless herself with, but Providence came to
the rescue and carried off our old Vicar with influenza.</p>

<p>Serlo, isn’t it? I thought I saw him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rosie.</span></p>

<p>She’s a dear, isn’t she? I’m so fond of her, and she’s simply devoted to
Lewis.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>My dear, do you never say anything against any one?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rosie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] Seldom. Everybody’s so nice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It must make conversation very difficult. But Ethel is a charming girl,
and I shouldn’t like her to fall into the hands of that disgraceful
young rip.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Withers.</span></p>

<p>She’s the only one of the family who hasn’t had her head turned by all
the money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Of course you knew Mrs. Jennings before she was the exalted person she
is now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Withers.</span></p>

<p>Bless you, I’ve known her all my life. We went to the Brixton High
School together, and I was a bridesmaid at her wedding. Why, we used to
be popping in and out of one another’s houses all day long.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Withers.</span></p>

<p>And now, if you please, she’ll hardly look at us.<a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Abbott.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid people don’t much like her at Taverner, but she’s done
everything she could for us, and they’re awfully generous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rosie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t care what anybody says about her, she’s been perfectly sweet to
me. She told me that I might come to the Hall whenever I wanted to, and
I’m always dropping in to lunch there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Oh well, if they’re nice to you, I forgive them. Mrs. Jennings can cut
me till she’s blue in the face.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>What is the news in Pomerania?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>None except that our Emperor is growing old. All these domestic troubles
of his are breaking him down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Poor old thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I suppose nothing has been heard of the Archduke Sebastian?<a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>Nothing. We’ve given up the search.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Wanley</span>.] You remember that affair, don’t you? There was some
quarrel in the domestic circle, and the Archduke Sebastian suddenly
disappeared&mdash;four years ago, now, isn’t it?&mdash;and hasn’t been heard of
since. He simply vanished into thin air.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But how do you know he’s alive?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>Every Christmas the Emperor receives a letter from him, sent from
different parts of the world, saying he’s well and happy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s really very romantic. I wonder what on earth he’s doing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>Heaven only knows.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Tell me, how is that nice young <i>attaché</i> of yours that I met at
luncheon the other day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>The nice young <i>attaché</i> has come to a bad end. I’ve had to send him
back to Pomerania.<a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>The story is rather entertaining. There’s an American woman here who has
a passion for titles, and it occurred to my <i>attaché</i> one day to
introduce his valet to her as Count So-and-So. Of course she was full of
attentions and immediately asked the valet to dinner. Presently the
story came to my ears. I really couldn’t have my <i>attachés</i> playing
practical jokes of that sort, and so I sent him home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Poor boy, he was so nice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, may I introduce Mr. Abbott to you. He’s your new Vicar at Taverner.
And this is Mrs. Abbott. You must be very nice to her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>I’m delighted to meet you. I’ve heard wonderful stories of your good
works in the parish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Abbott.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>What are they?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well, although you have glided over the point with singular discretion,
it is plain that you do not want me to assume a certain character merely
in order to enjoy a private snigger at the expense of these amiable
people.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think I know what you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Madam, it is always dangerous to count too much on the stupidity of
one’s fellows. We shall arrange this matter much better if you realise
that I’m a person of some shrewdness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Go on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It is evident that you wish these good folk to take me to their bosom in
order that you may have the opportunity of telling them one day that I’m
merely an impostor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I really hadn’t thought about that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I venture to suspect that you rate your intelligence too low.<a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Well, what is your condition?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>The position will be very humiliating to me. For all I know it may bring
me into uncomfortable relations with the police.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I think the whole plan had better be dropped. It will lead to endless
bother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I have no wish to drop it. You want to revenge yourself on some people
who have insulted you. I, for reasons of my own, am willing to help. But
I make the condition that you do not disclose the truth till I give you
leave. I promise not to withhold it unreasonably.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I accept that. And the second condition?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Is very easy. I insist that you should behave towards me, whether we’re
alone or in public, as you naturally would if I were really the
individual I propose to personate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>That’s only fair. Now who can we suggest that you should be?<a name="page_43" id="page_43"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You’d better try and invent some character who you’re quite sure doesn’t
exist.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>We want something very extravagant and high-sounding.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Pray do not put yourselves to the trouble of thinking. You will
introduce me to your friends as the Archduke Sebastian of Pomerania.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But that’s a real person!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>To invent an imaginary one would be ridiculous. Your friends would only
need to look in the Almanack de Gotha to discover the fraud.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But Count von Bremer was talking to us about him just now. The Archduke
Sebastian is the man who mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It’s because his whereabouts are unknown that he’s the safest person to
choose.<a name="page_44" id="page_44"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You would never be able to pass yourself off for an Archduke.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Strange as it may seem to you, a royal prince eats, drinks, breathes,
and behaves generally very much like men of baser clay.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>You’d be found out in a week.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But how do you know I’m not the Archduke Sebastian?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a scornful laugh.</i>] You look it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>What have you been doing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been lettin’ Jennings’ Patent Hardware stand me a lunch. My word,
that old woman’s so vulgar she just about takes the roof of your head
off.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Why do you lunch with people you thoroughly despise?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Despise ’em! I don’t despise people who’ve got eighty thousand a year.
They’re trying to hook me for their girl.</p>

<p>And are you proposing to&mdash;throw yourself away?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>She’s a very neat-steppin’ little filly&mdash;swallowed a poker in her

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I admire your romantic air.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Whoever talked of romance? There’s half a million down on one side and

<p>Well, as soon as we can get over a triflin’ impediment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>What’s that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, the filly’s kicking. Have to put a red ribbon on her tail, don’t

<p>I’m afraid I haven’t your intimate knowledge of the peerage, but I

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, about three hundred and fifty.<a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a></p>

<p>By George, that’s cheerful. D’you want me to shake hands with them all?</p>

<p>They’re the very best people in the county, sir. <i>Crème de la crème.</i></p>

<p>Aren’t we always?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Then let us be frank at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, ten days ago your people were all over me. I suppose you know why
as well as I do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>D’you think we need talk of that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Frankness is rather tryin’, ain’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>No. Please go on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>It was dear Lord Serlo all day long; they couldn’t have enough of me.
Rippin’ good chap, Serlo. Just the sort of cove one would like to have
for a son-in-law.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Lord Serlo!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Half a mo. I ain’t done yet. Eminently suitable match, and all that sort
of thing, only the young lady couldn’t stick me at any price.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why you should say this.<a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Better have it out, you know; rotten, keepin’ things on your chest.
Don’t blame the young lady. Don’t know that I should much fancy myself
if I was a blushing damsel. Not everybody’s money. Got a bit damaged in
transit, eh, what? Been mixed up in one or two scandals. Not the right
thing for an old-established marquess. Bit inclined to drink. No harm in
him, you know, but not the sort of man you’d like to spend the rest of
your life with. Young woman got a mind of her own. Lets the noble lord
see she wouldn’t take him if he was given away with a pound of tea. All
right, says noble lord, bet’s off. Not much, says mother of young woman.
Half a million goin’ beggin’. Give her time to get used to you.
Fascinating cove really. More she knows you more she’ll like you. Come
down and stay in the country.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] How can you talk such nonsense!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>All right, says noble lord, I’m on. Jolly nice girl, and all that sort
of thing. Noble lord rather smit. Thinks if she’ll have him he’ll turn
over a new leaf&mdash;give up everythin’ rotten and try and make her a good
husband. Rather taken with the idea of double harness. He may look a
fool, but noble lord knows a good thing when he sees it, and the young
lady’s about the best thing he’s ever set eyes on.<a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Are you talking seriously by any chance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Now don’t interrupt me. I’ve just got into a good steady canter, and
I’ll get it all off my chest at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I’m so sorry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, when eligible marquess gets down in the country, what d’you think
he finds? Blessed if there ain’t a foreign prince on the scene. My word,
that’s enough to put the noble lord’s aristocratic nose right out of
joint, ain’t it? Look here, old boy, you keep your weather eye open, and
all that sort of thing, says the noble lord to himself. May be an ass,
don’t you know, but when there’s a bloomin’ hurricane comin’ along he
can see which way the wind is blowin’. Brother rather chilly, father
rather chilly, mother regular iceberg. All right, says noble lord to
himself, but what about Pretty Polly?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Is that me by any chance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>For the last month Pretty Polly had been simply turnin’ her back on
noble lord, snubbin’ him right and left, and all of a sudden she becomes
extraordinary affable. Hulloa, what’s this, says noble lord, and his<a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a>
little heart goes pit-a-pat. He may be a fool, but he ain’t a damned
fool, and in a day or two he tumbles to it. So, like a wise man, he
packs his bag and hooks it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what on earth you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you? Well, will you have it straight from the shoulder?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>We agreed to be quite frank.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>All right. No spoof. My dear, I just saw that you were fairly knocked
silly by the Archduke, and there wasn’t a ghost of a chance for little
Ned Serlo.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It’s not true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, it is. You see, I’m a bit knocked silly myself, and that makes
you precious far-sighted.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>You!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>All right, you needn’t get up on your hind legs. I’m not goin’ to
propose to you now. I know it would be no precious good. At first I
didn’t care twopence; it<a name="page_69" id="page_69"></a> was just a business arrangement&mdash;half a
million down on one side and an old-established marquisate on the other.
But now.... Well, you know I’m rather an ass at saying what I mean&mdash;when
I really mean it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I’m very sorry. I’m afraid I’ve been unkind to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, you haven’t. I do seem a rotten little bounder, don’t I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>No, I think you might be an awfully good friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>It’s jolly of you to say so. You know, I can’t stick your family. Can
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] You see, I knew them before they were rich. When you’ve
lived all your life in a sordid narrow way, it’s very hard to have such
enormous wealth as ours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>You make allowances for them, but you never did for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It would have been very impertinent of me.<a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>It never struck you that it’s devilish hard to be a marquess with no
means of livelihood but your title. And the worst of a title is that
it’ll get you plenty of credit, but dooced little hard cash.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I never thought of that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, look here, what I wanted to say is this: it’s no business of mine
about the Archduke. You know, I don’t know much about royalty, but I
don’t think a foreign prince is likely to marry the daughter of nobody
in particular just because she’s got nice eyes and a pot of money.
[<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>is about to speak</i>.] No, let me go on. You may be going to have
a rotten time, and I just want you to know that if at any time you want
me&mdash;well, you know what I mean, don’t you. Let’s forget that you’re an
heiress, and I’m an old-established marquess. You’re an awfully ripping
sort, and I’m just Ned Serlo. I’m not a bad sort either, and perhaps we
might be happy together.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Touched.</i>] It’s very charming of you. I’m so glad that I know you
better now. Whatever happens I know I can count on you.<a name="page_71" id="page_71"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>That’s all right then. Meanwhile noble lord’s goin’ to hook it&mdash;leave
the coast clear, and bear it like a man, don’t you know.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well, how are the weather and the crops?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather surprised.</i>] Blessed if I know, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I merely asked because you looked as if you’d been discussing them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He gives</i> <span class="smcap">Serlo</span> <i>a glance</i>. <span class="smcap">Serlo</span> <i>shows no sign of moving</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I’m not driving you away, am I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Getting up.</i>] Not at all, sir. I thought I’d go and have a look at the
party.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Do go and pretend you’re me, there’s a good fellow, and shake hands with
some of those confounded people. You’ll see where I ought to stand,
because there’s a little piece of red carpet on the lawn.<a name="page_72" id="page_72"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid they’re not takin’ any of me, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>The only advantage I’ve ever been able to find in being a royal
personage is that when anybody’s in your way you just tell him to go,
and he goes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Why did you want Lord Serlo to go, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Because I wanted to be alone with you. Ask me another, quickly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Oughtn’t I to help mother to receive people?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you ought. But, you see, that’s another advantage of being a
royal personage, that you can’t go till I give you your dismissal. I
say, don’t you hate parties?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Dreadfully.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>So do I. Let’s pretend there isn’t one, shall we? I say, why don’t you
sit down and make yourself comfy?<a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I should like to have a little talk with you, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>That’s jolly. I wish we had a regiment of soldiers there to turn all
those people out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>May I say anything I like to you, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, why not?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Until I was sixteen the most exalted person I’d ever met in my life was
a London County Councillor. I’m not quite sure if I know how to behave
with royal personages.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Why on earth don’t you buy a book on etiquette? I always carry one about
with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Mother bought several when you said you’d come down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if she’s got the same as mine. You know I never can remember to
call a serviette a napkin.<a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Mamma’s very particular about that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>And look here, d’you know that you ought never to call a chicken a fowl?
It’s awfully bad form. I wonder if that’s in your mother’s books. I say,
what charming eyes you have.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>That’s another of the advantages of being a royal personage, that you
can make pretty speeches, and no one takes them seriously.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But you know, I’m a very insignificant royal personage. You mustn’t
think I’m anything very grand really.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It’s very nice of you to say so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You see, there are seventy-nine archdukes and duchesses in Pomerania. My
grandfather had seventeen children, and they all married. How many
children would each have had to make seventy-nine of us?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It sounds very difficult.<a name="page_75" id="page_75"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But you see I can’t be very important, can I? And of course I’ve got
practically no money to speak of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It’s very good of you to put me at my ease. Then you wont mind if I say
exactly what I want to?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You won’t give me good advice, will you? I’ve got seventy-nine
relations, and they all do that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t venture.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I’ll bear whatever else you say with fortitude. We’ll pretend that
you’re just Miss So-and-So.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>As in point of fact, I am.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>And that I’m&mdash;Jack Straw.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Surprised.</i>] Why on earth Jack Straw?<a name="page_76" id="page_76"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indifferently.</i>] It’s the name of a public-house in Hampstead. Pray go
on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I wondered if you’d do me a great favour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Ask me for the moon, and it shall be left at your front door by Carter
Paterson to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It’s something much simpler than that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Put me out of suspense quickly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I should be very much obliged if&mdash;if you’d go away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Much surprised.</i>] I? Now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t mean actually this minute. But if it suited your arrangements
to go to-morrow....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you want me to go away altogether?<a name="page_77" id="page_77"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>That is precisely what I did mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Couldn’t you ask me something easier than that? Ask me for a lawyer who
never told a lie, and I’ll deliver him to you, bound hand and foot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I don’t happen to want one just at this moment, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But I’m having a very jolly time down here.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a change of tone.</i>] Don’t you see that you’re exposing me every
day to the most cruel humiliation?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I thought I was making myself so pleasant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t pretend you don’t understand. I’ve seen the twinkle in your
eyes when my mother set a little trap for you to fall in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I always fall in very neatly.<a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>But what do you think I felt when I knew how clearly you saw that she
was throwing me at your head?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It’s a distinctly pleasing sensation to have a pretty girl thrown at
your head.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It was only a joke to you; you don’t know how ashamed I was.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But why do you suppose I came down to Taverner&mdash;to see your father and
mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why you came&mdash;unless it was to make me desperately
wretched.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>What would you say if I told you that I came because I loved you at
first sight?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I should say that your Royal Highness was very polite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Now, look here, don’t you think I’m rather nice, really?<a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It would surely be very impertinent of me to have any opinion on the
subject.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Our friend Serlo would describe that as one in the eye.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Would you allow me to go back to my mother’s guests, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Imperturbably.</i>] Do you think you’d like me any better if I weren’t an
Archduke?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t thought about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Then please give the matter your immediate attention.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I should certainly like you no less.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I have no doubt that if I were just a penniless adventurer you’d simply
dote upon me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know if I’d put it quite so strongly as that.<a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You know, I’m afraid you’re hopelessly romantic. You’ve confessed your
attachment to me, and just because I happen incautiously to have chosen
an Emperor for my grandfather, you want me to go away. It’s so
unreasonable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>But I haven’t confessed anything of the sort.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I look upon your request that I should go away as equivalent to an
avowal of undying passion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Shall I tell you what I would say to you if you weren’t an Archduke?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I’d say you were the most audacious, impudent, and impertinent man I’d
ever seen in my life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She gives a rapid, ironical curtsey, and goes out. He is about to

<p>Ah, I was hoping to have the pleasure of seeing you. You wrote me a

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] I ventured to ask if I might have a few minutes’ private
conversation with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you wouldn’t mind waiting here. I will rejoin you immediately.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p>You know, he positively freezes me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I think it’s wonderful. One couldn’t suspect for a moment that he’s
only....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He looks round.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>No one will come here. We can talk quite safely.</p>

<p>I wish to goodness we hadn’t ever thought of this fool trick. I knew it
would lead to all sorts of bother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s no good saying that now. We must keep our heads and get out of it

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s just like a man. You’re trying to put the whole blame on me.
What are <i>you</i> going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Well, we must finish with it as quickly as we can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Whatever happens, there must be no scene. I couldn’t bear to see him
publicly humiliated.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Why on earth should you think of him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m such a fool, Ambrose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>My dear, what <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>After all, I’m not a girl&mdash;I’m the mother of two healthy boys with
enormous appetites. I think the man has bewitched me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Good Lord!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s no good saying that. Of course he’s the most fascinating creature
I’ve ever seen in my life.<a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you’re seriously in love with him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>A widow with a sense of humour is never seriously in love with anybody.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>But I think it’s much better the young man should disappear as
mysteriously as he came.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>There we’re quite agreed. And we’ll tell him so with considerable
frankness.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think you’re in a very good humour this afternoon, Mr. Holland.
I venture to think your manners leave something to be desired.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Look here, we’ve had enough of this tomfoolery.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Pray sit down. It distresses me to see you standing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I believe the man’s out of his senses.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very amiably.</i>] Have you forgotten the waiter’s uniform which fitted
you so wonderfully, Mr. Straw?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] Quite. I only remember the condition your ladyship was good
enough to agree to, when I accepted your humorous suggestion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>But, look here, we must talk the matter out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I am quite willing to listen to you, my dear Holland. Your conversation
is often interesting and sometimes epigrammatic. I stipulate only that
you should use<a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a> those forms of politeness which are usual between a
person of your position and a person of mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I should never have consented to this folly if I’d known to what it was
going to lead. In a moment of uncontrollable irritation, because Mrs.
Jennings had behaved with the greatest insolence to a defenceless girl,
we made up our minds to punish her. There was no great harm in it. We
thought perhaps she’d ask you to dinner, and there would be an end of
it. It never dawned on us that you’d come and stay here indefinitely.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear fellow, why should you blame me for your own lack of
intelligence?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Ugh!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span> <i>goes over and sits beside</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Wanley</span>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Our friend is quite incoherent, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>We want you to go away, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Do you? I say, what a jolly frock. Where did you get it?<a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little laugh, disarmed by his impudence.</i>] You’re perfectly
irresistible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You’ve taken the words out of my mouth, that’s just what I was going to
say to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Are you ever serious?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Always when I’m talking to a pretty woman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I wish I could understand you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear lady, I’ve been trying to understand myself for the last thirty
odd years. By the way, how old am I, Holland?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>How the deuce should I know?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear fellow, I think it’s very careless of you. You might have
looked it out. Supposing some one had asked me my age?<a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I wish you really were a royal personage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It does seem hard that a waiter should have such a way with him, doesn’t
it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Confidentially.</i>] Who are you really?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Your devoted servant, madam. Who could be anything else after knowing
you for ten minutes?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s charming of you to say so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I am very nice, aren’t I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Much too nice. That is why I beseech your Royal Highness graciously to
take his departure.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You know, you haven’t yet told me where you got that frock.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I bought it in Paris. Do you like it?<a name="page_88" id="page_88"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It’s ripping. And it suits you admirably.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Isabel, Isabel, we came here to be sensible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>My dear Ambrose, let me be sensible in my own way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear Holland, I wonder if you’d very much mind going to see if my
red carpet is still in its place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I’m not going to be made a fool of by you, my friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Why not? You’re doing it very well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be piggy, Ambrose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>What on earth do you want me to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>I’m simply dying of thirst. I wish you’d get me a glass of lemonade.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I have no intention whatever of stirring from this spot.<a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been wondering for the last week what I should do if I signified
his dismissal to any one, and he flatly refused to go. Very awkward,
isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Mahomet and the mountain isn’t in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Of course a hundred years ago I’d have cast him into a dungeon. But,
between ourselves, I don’t happen to have a dungeon handy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Now look here, we’ve had enough of this nonsense. The joke has gone far
enough. Are you going or not?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well, if you ask me point blank, I’m not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>But don’t you know that I have only to say two words for you to be
kicked out of the house by the servants?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You forget that you’d be undoubtedly kicked out with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Now look here, Jack, we’ve been old pals, and we’ve gone through a deuce
of a lot together. I don’t want<a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a> to say beastly things to you. I know
I’ve made a fool of myself, but you’re a decent chap. You must see that
it’s necessary for you to go at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me see anything of the sort. I have no other
engagements, and the country is charming at this time of year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You’re behaving like a common impostor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>What language to use to a royal personage! I assure you we’re not used
to such frankness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Do you deliberately refuse to go?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Deliberately.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>And shall I tell you why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I happen to know, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You’re going to commit the most disgraceful action of your life. Do you
think any one can’t see that you’re madly in love with Ethel Jennings?<a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Springing to her feet.</i>] Is that true?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Quite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Then why have you been flirting with me so disgracefully?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I assure you I had no intention of doing so. It must be my unfortunate
manner.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s an unfortunate manner that’s quite likely to get you into trouble
with widow ladies.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>In that case you can only applaud my determination to marry as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Not Ethel Jennings?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>You must be joking?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear madam, when I make a joke I always laugh quickly, so that there
should be no doubt about it.<a name="page_92" id="page_92"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>It’s preposterous. I shall allow you to do nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear fellow, what is the use of getting violently excited about it?
More especially as I haven’t yet proposed to the young lady.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I think you must be stark staring mad. You don’t suppose for a moment
that we shall allow you to carry out such an odious deception. I can’t
imagine how you can even think of anything so heartless and cruel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>It’s going too far. You must understand that it’s impossible. I beseech
you to leave Taverner immediately.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It drives me to distraction that I should have to refuse your smallest
whim, but in this matter [<i>with a dramatic flourish</i>] I am adamant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Now, look here, we’ve talked about it enough. Either you leave this
place immediately or I shall tell Mrs. Jennings the whole story.<a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It is only fair to give you that satisfaction. That was part of our
arrangement.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You realise the consequences?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very amiably.</i>] I did that before I entered into your scheme.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You leave me no alternative.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear Holland, I really believe you’re rather nervous about the
disclosure which it is evidently your duty to make.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>For your own sake I ask you once more: will you give me your word of
honour to leave the house and under no circumstances communicate with
any member of the family?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It’s charming of you to give me one more chance. I can only repeat that
I am deeply in love with Ethel, and I have every intention of marrying
her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Your blood be upon your own head.<a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a></p>

<p>I say, is this any business of mine? Shall I hook it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Jennings, I’m afraid there’s no use in my trying to excuse myself.
I had better just tell you everything as shortly as I can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Holland, don’t you think it can wait till later? The duchess ’as
just come, and it’ll look so funny if I’m not there to receive her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Holland has a communication to make which cannot fail to interest
you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, of course, if it’s your Royal ’Ighness’s wish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I daresay you remember that a fortnight ago we all met at the Grand
Babylon Hotel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>How could I forget, when that was the auspicious occasion of my
introduction to his Royal ’Ighness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Ambrose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You may remember, also, that Mr. and Mrs. Abbott were sitting with us in
the lounge.<a name="page_98" id="page_98"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I ’ave other things to do than to remember where Mr. and Mrs. Abbott
were sitting.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I daresay you’ve forgotten that you behaved very cruelly to her. We were
all very indignant. We thought it necessary to punish you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Really, Mr. Holland, I don’t know who you think you’re talking to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I find it very difficult to say what I have to&mdash;I realise now that the
whole business has been preposterously silly&mdash;I can manage far better if
you don’t interrupt.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Please let him go on, Mrs. Jennings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Of, of course, if your Royal ’Ighness wishes it I ’ave no more to say.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>It struck me that it would be amusing to pass off a nobody as a person
of great consequence. I had just recognised one of the waiters as an old
friend of mine. I introduced him to you as the Archduke Sebastian of
Pomerania.<a name="page_99" id="page_99"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you fool, you fool! You’ve ’ad the education. You’ve been to Oxford,

the difference between an archduke and a waiter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>Serlo didn’t spot him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

It’s your Royal ’Ighness this, and your Royal ’Ighness that. And we<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a> had

word in edgeways.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’m listening.</p>

<p>Yes, do.</p>

<p>If you ask my advice, that is what I should recommend.</p>

<p>All the county’s here, Maria. <i>Crème de la crème.</i><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

<p>Oh, I wish they were all dead. I know why they come here. D’you think I
don’t know that they call me a vulgar old woman behind my back? But they
come all the same because I’ve got two millions of money. I’m so rich
that they can’t ’elp coming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You know, I don’t want to seem stuck up, but in point of fact they’ve
come to-day to meet me. Don’t you think I’d better go and make myself
amiable to them?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>’Ave I got to introduce you to the duchess?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid she’ll make a point of it. Even duchesses have a weakness for
royal personages.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>If she ever finds out!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>The situation is not without an element of humour.<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, upon my soul, you ’ave got a cheek!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>The motto on my coat of arms is audacity. Only we put it in Latin

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>Your coat of arms, I like that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear fellow, I have no doubt it is as authentic as yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And do you mean to say I’ve got to pretend I don’t know anything?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I think it’s the only thing to do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I can never do it. I shall never ’old up my ’ead again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Come. I am convinced that the duchess is growing restive. I will murmur
a few soft nothings in her ear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, I suppose the only thing is to risk it. But you just wait,

<p>Oh, it give me such a turn. What’s to be done now? The Count.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>How d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I’d forgotten all about him. Count von Bremer coming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Who the deuce is he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>He’s your ambassador.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Of course, how stupid of me!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little scornful smile.</i>] But he won’t come.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you make too sure about that. He’s coming right enough. The
British aristocracy was quite willing to ’ob-nob with the
Parker-Jennings, but this duty foreigner wouldn’t be seen in the same
street with us. And you all sniggered up your sleeves, because you
thought you was getting a bit of your own back. But I’ve got ’im to-day,
and I was going to fling him in your faces. I wrote ’im a personal
letter&mdash;as if I’d known him all my life&mdash;and said....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And said ’is Royal ’Ighness particularly wished him to come. I sent the
letter by one of the footmen this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>By Jove!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>Well, they mustn’t meet. You must say that the Archduke has been seized
with sudden indisposition.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Every one knows he was quite well half an hour ago.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>Besides, Count von Bremer would probably insist on seeing him. It must
have come as a great surprise that the Archduke Sebastian had turned
up.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear people, don’t put yourselves out. If Count von Bremer has come
here to see me, it would be manifestly most discourteous to rob him of
that pleasure.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>I think you’re quite mad, Jack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Unless I’m greatly mistaken, Count von Bremer has excessively bad sight.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you’re going to meet ’im face to face?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Remember that there are eighty-one Archdukes in Pomerania.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>You told me seventy-nine a little while ago.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I have since seen in the paper that the Archduchess Anastasia has had
twins, which makes eighty-one. What more probable than that the
Ambassador has never seen the Archduke Sebastian?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but what a risk to take. It’s enough to turn my false ’air grey.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>In any case, he can’t have set eyes on him for four years, because
nobody has.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it ’asn’t struck you that he may talk to you in Pomeranian.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Have you ever met a waiter who couldn’t discourse fluently in seven
languages at least?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Does that mean you can talk the Count’s beastly language?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Like a beastly native, madam. But I may suggest to you that there will
be no need, since if I address the Count in English it would be the
height of discourtesy for him to answer in any other tongue.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, of all the cheek I’ve ever come across in my life, you just about

<p>Do you think I’ve not seen it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>It went off beautifully; no one can deny that. There wasn’t a hitch.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little cry of rage.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Parker-Jennings</span>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Apologetically.</i>] My dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] You’ve been and gone and made another old fool of
yourself, Jennings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a deprecating laugh.</i>] I’m afraid it’s the same old fool as
usual, Maria.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Don’t make jokes at me, Robert. Keep them for your City friends.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>He’s had breakfast.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>’As he indeed. At ’alf-past eleven. He’s not putting himself out, is he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>When’s he going, father?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>It isn’t a question of when he’s going. Your father went to him and said
he was to clear out before twelve o’clock or we’d send for the police,
come what might. That’s what you told him, Robert, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>You always were a fool, Jennings. What have you done now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear, he insisted on having one of the footmen in the room. He
said he didn’t like this English habit of ours of having no servants at
the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you let him order my servants about?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>My dear, what could I do? There was one of them in the room at the
time.<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And you sat by while he ate his breakfast?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>He has a very healthy appetite, Maria.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Don’t talk to me. You must ’ave ’ad some opportunity to give him a piece
of your mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear, we were left alone for a minute.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Helplessly.</i>] He was so affable that....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Affable! Oh, you blithering fool. Wait till I get a word with him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear, why didn’t you get rid of him last night?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>How could I get rid of ’im last night, with eighteen people come to
dinner to meet ’im?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>What about Lady Wanley?<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I never want to set eyes on her again. I know she was at the bottom
of this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>But I thought you’d sent for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>So I ’ave, and for Holland too. They got us into the mess, and they must
get us out of it. It’s just as bad for them as for us now. That’s one
comfort.</p>

<p>Hulloa, there you are! I was just hunting around for some one to give me

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] I ’ope you ’ad a comfortable breakfast.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Aggressively.</i>] Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Jolly party you gave yesterday, Mrs. Jennings. It was a great success,
wasn’t it? [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings</span>.] By the way, what was that
port we drank last night?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>No, you don’t, my friend. You may be able to bluff Jennings, but you
don’t bluff me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Bluff? Bluff? I flatter myself on my knowledge of English, but I don’t
think I’ve ever come across that word.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Haven’t you? Perhaps you ’aven’t come across the word skilly either?
But, unless you look out, you’ll know what it is before you want to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You talk in riddles, dear lady. I always think it a fatiguing habit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’ll make myself clear. Don’t you ’ave any fear about that.<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sitting down lazily.</i>] I can’t help feeling the interval between
breakfast and luncheon in a country house is one of the most agreeable
moments of the day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>See that there’s no one about, Vincent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>It’s all right, mater.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him blandly.</i>] You have all the airs of a conspirator in a
romantic play, my friend. You only want a false beard and some blue
spectacles to make the picture perfect.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Now then, you listen to me, young man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You flatter me, madam.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>We’ve talked it over, my ’usband and me, and we’re no fools, whatever
you may think. You richly deserve to be ’anded over to the police.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>One moment. To which character are you now addressing yourself, to the
Archduke Sebastian or the waiter from the Grand Babylon Hotel?<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if you don’t take care, I’ll give you such a box on the ears.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You certainly wouldn’t do that to a royal personage, would you? You must
be concerned for the moment with Jack Straw.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>It may surprise you, but I ’ave been for the last ’alf hour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I thought your manner had been a little abrupt.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I was saying that you richly deserved to be ’anded over to the police.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>There may be two opinions on that question, but we will let it pass.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>But we don’t want a scandal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>One has to be so careful in the smart set, doesn’t one?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And we’re willing to let you go. Your luggage shall be packed, the motor
shall take you to the station.<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>Mother, we shall all have to see him off, or it’ll look so fishy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we’ll see him off. Anything to get rid of ’im safely. There’s a
train in an hour from now. And I ’ave only one piece of advice to you,
and that is, take the chance while you’ve got it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>It’s very kind of you, but I’m extremely comfortable here.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>You make me laugh.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I always think it hard that it should be so difficult to make people do
that when you’re trying to be funny, and so easy when you’re trying to
be serious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>You don’t want me to tell my footman to take you by the scruff of the
neck, and....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear lady, let us keep perfectly calm. It would become neither of us
to lose our tempers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say you won’t go?<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>You put it in such a brutal way. Let us say rather, that I cannot tear
myself away from your hospitable roof.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Ha, and how long do you propose to give us the honour of your company?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Well, I really haven’t quite made up my mind. I’m proposing to await
developments.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Send for the police, Robert. I won’t put up with it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>You know, mother....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Hold your tongue, Vincent.... [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>.] Oh, my friend, I’m
sorry for you. Those nice white ’ands of yours will look pretty after
they’ve been picking oakum for six months.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I had an idea that had been abolished in England.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh no, I think not.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Ah, perhaps it was the treadmill I was thinking of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well, Vincent, ’ow much longer are you going to stand there like a
stuffed owl?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Do my eyes deceive me, or is that a local paper that I see? [<i>He takes
it up.</i>] Ah, I surmised that it would have an account of your garden
party. Two columns of it, by Jove! You must wish you hadn’t asked so
many people. [<i>Reading.</i>] The Duchess of St. Erth, the Marchioness of
Mereston, the Marquess of Mereston, Lord and Lady Hollington, Viscount
Parnaby&mdash;dear me, how smart&mdash;Lady Wanley, Mr. and Mrs. Lamberville, the
Bishop of Sheffield, and the Honourable Mrs. Spratte.... I say, won’t
your humbler friends grind their teeth with envy. But doesn’t it say
anything about me? Here it is. [<i>Reading.</i>] “The Archduke Sebastian
looked every inch a prince.” I said so. [<i>Reading to himself.</i>] Oh,
spare my blushes. [<i>Aloud.</i>] “His Royal Highness enchanted every one by
the grace of his bearing and the charm of his Imperial personality.”
Blood will tell.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings</span>.] Are you going to stand there and let this man
insult me, Robert?<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Blandly.</i>] And what do you imagine all these noble and distinguished
persons will think when they read in the next number of the local paper
that the royal personage whose hand they were so pleased to shake&mdash;I did
my duty like a hero, didn’t I?&mdash;was serving coffee and liqueurs a
fortnight ago in the Grand Babylon Hotel?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, be quiet, you....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I can hear a titter rising softly in the village, with the doctor and
the parson and the solicitor, whom you didn’t ask to your party, and I
can hear it increase to a ripple of laughter as the story spreads
through Cheshire. I can hear a Homeric peal as it travels from county to
county. It’s a great guffaw in Manchester and Liverpool and the cities
of the North, and already I hear the deep laughter of Bristol and
Portsmouth and the West. And when it reaches London&mdash;you know how things
go in London, it’s so large that it takes it a little time really to get
hold of anything, but when at last it comes, can’t you see the huge city
holding its aching sides and bellowing with laughter. But I’ll tell you
who won’t see the joke&mdash;[<i>taking up the paper and reading</i>]&mdash;oh, they’ll
laugh very much on the wrong side of their mouths; the Duchess of St.
Erth, the Marchioness of Mereston, and my Lady Hollington and my Lord
Parnaby, and the Bishop of Sheffield and the Honourable Mrs. Spratte.<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you devil!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I can see you flying before the laughter like three tremulous leaves
before the wind, and the laughter will pursue you to Paris, where
they’ll make little songs about you on the boulevards, and the Riviera,
where they’ll sell your photographs on picture postcards. I can see you
fleeing across the Atlantic to hide your heads in the immensity of
America, and there the Yellow Press, pea-green with frenzy, will pile
column of ridicule upon column of invective. Oh, my dear lady, do you
think it isn’t worth while to endure six months hard labour to amuse the
world so profoundly?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

Why should it shock you when it is a waiter who for the same reason

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>Lady Wanley’s talking to him. She’ll detain him as long as she can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Blessings on her! I’ll forgive ’er everything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Oh, please go while you have a chance. I couldn’t bear to see you
arrested.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Why should you care?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Now, look here. You’ve played a nasty trick on me, but you’ve got the
cheek of the devil. I don’t want you to get into trouble. I don’t know
what there is about you, but I can’t ’elp liking you.<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Madam, only the importunate presence of your lord and master prevents me
from hurling myself at your feet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t talk stuff. I want to ’elp you to get away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a dramatic gesture.</i>] Madam, my mother’s only son has never fled
before a foe. I will stay and face the music.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I’m not thinking of myself now. If there is a scandal I’m rich enough to
make people forget it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>I say, old man, you’d better hook it. England’s no place for you just
now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In an undertone.</i>] If you care for me at all, don’t run this horrible
risk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>If you were only pressing me to stay this unanimity would be extremely
flattering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>The man’s mad. The man’s as mad as a March ’are. He ought to be shut up
in a lunatic asylum.<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I forget if Napoleon was one of my ancestors, but I feel just like him
at this moment. “J’y suis, j’y reste.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>In point of fact it was MacMahon who said that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a noble flourish.</i>] I prefer to think it was Napoleon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>They’re just strolling along.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Then it’s too late. And it’s all got to come out before Florrie Withers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vincent.</span></p>

<p>[<i>From the window.</i>] I say, Lady Wanley is making him look at the roses.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>She is a brick; she’s gaining every moment she can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>By the way, talking about roses, have you had that bunch put in a basket
that I cut for Mrs. Withers?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I should like to take you by the neck and strangle you.<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>I couldn’t come before. I have only just received the answer to my

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Have you good news for me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>The best. The Emperor agrees to all your wishes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Bless his old head.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>His Majesty is all eagerness to see you again. He is expecting a letter
from you by every post. [<i>He goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.] Madam, I am commanded
by my august master to offer you his most cordial greeting.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know if I’m standing on my ’ead or my ’eels.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Then nothing remains but for me to make my declaration in due form. Mrs.
Jennings, I have my grandfather’s permission to ask you for your
daughter’s hand in marriage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Breaking out.</i>] But the man’s an impostor. He’s no more the Archduke
Sebastian than I am.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Withers.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, if you like you can ’ave it. You were there when it all
started. I suppose I got out the wrong side of bed that morning, and
when Mrs. Thing-a-magig, the Vicar’s wife, come up to me at the Grand
Babylon Hotel, I snubbed her. I’ve been very sorry for it since, and
I’ve been punished for it. They knew I was an old snob&mdash;like you,
Florrie&mdash;they<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a> thought they’d pay me out. They got one of the waiters
from the ’otel to dress up like a gentleman, and they introduced him as
the Archduke Sebastian.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Withers.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Straw</span>.] That?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that! He’s a waiter, that’s what he is. And for the last week I’ve
been making a perfect fool of myself over ’im.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Much mystified.</i>] But&mdash;I don’t understand. I’ve known the Archduke
Sebastian since he was born.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>You’re mistaken. This person and I were in America together. I lived
with him for two years. I don’t know his real name, but he passes under
that of Jack Straw.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>But what you say is absurd. I know him as well as my own son.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say he really is an Archduke?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>Of course he is. The only mystery is how he turned up here when we’ve
been hunting the whole world for the last four years to find him.<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Holland.</span></p>

<p>But are you the Jack Straw who was with me in the States?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Wanley.</span></p>

<p>And are you the waiter of the Grand Babylon Hotel?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And are you the Archduke Sebastian of Pomerania?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’m jiggered.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you will allow me to explain. Four years ago I fell desperately
in love with a lady whose speciality it was to kick higher than any one
else in the world. She could kick a man’s tall hat off his head with
such grace that I asked her to marry me. My grandfather refused to
consent, and the lady was hurried over the frontier. [<i>With a glance at</i>
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.] I was a romantic dog myself in those days, and I followed her,
only to find that she had already three more or less lawful husbands.
The sight of them, and the conviction that her peculiar talent would not
greatly add to the felicity of domestic life, cured me of my passion.
But the world did seem a bit hollow and empty, and I<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a> thought I’d see
how it looked from the point of view of a man who had nothing but his
wits to live on. After trying it, I tell you frankly that I much prefer
living on the revenues which rise from the strength of arm of my
ancestors. When you saw me at the Grand Babylon Hotel I was preparing to
return to the bosom of my family, but I saw this young lady, and the
chance offering, decided to come down here. It was not unnatural that
when I was asked to assume a grandiloquent name I should assume my own.
Yesterday, when I met Count von Bremer, I begged him to wire to the
Emperor, asking for his consent to my marriage with Miss Ethel Jennings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Von Bremer.</span></p>

<p>I have only to add that the Emperor, delighted with the prospect of
seeing once more his favourite grandson, has gladly given his consent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>And when I think of all the things I’ve called you these last few
hours....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>They went in at the ear of a waiter, Madam, and slipped out at that of
an Archduke.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>And now it only rests with you to give peace to an aged Emperor,
satisfaction to eighty-one Archdukes, and happiness to your unworthy
servant.<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>I am engaged to be married to Lord Serlo.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>What! I know nothing about this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>I knew our mamma wouldn’t be pleased.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>The fact remains.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going to</i> <span class="smcap">Serlo</span>.] Now, my dear friend, you’ve got the chance of a
lifetime. It’s quite clear to me that there’s only one course open to
you. Take the centre of the stage and renounce the lady with all the
moving expressions you can think of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Look here, old man, I don’t think I quite like the way you keep on
pulling my leg.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Put a little dignity into it, man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>I may be a blithering ass, but I can see without your tellin’ me that
Ethel wouldn’t have had me at any price if she hadn’t wanted to score
off you.<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Oh, how some men throw away their chances! Strike the pathetic note, old
man, or you’re done. When you’ve finished there oughtn’t to be a dry eye
in the place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, the fact is&mdash;it had entirely slipped my memory at the moment, but
I had a letter this morning from the lady’s solicitor to remind me&mdash;I
happen to be engaged to a young woman who can kick a man’s topper off
too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>By Jove, I wonder if it’s the same one.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Serlo.</span></p>

<p>Well, you know, it was a bit awk when you&mdash;er....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Threw yourself at his head.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To Jack Straw with a smile.</i>] I ought to be very angry with you.
You’ve laughed at me all the time.<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a> I don’t believe you’ll ever take me
seriously. If I really were the romantic creature you say I am, I’d be
very dignified and refuse to have anything to do with you at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>But like all women you’re very sensible at heart, and you’ll do nothing
of the kind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span></p>

<p>It’s not because I’m sensible, but because I suppose you were quite
right in what you said just now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>Bless you! I’d throw myself down on the floor and implore you to walk on
me only I’m convinced you’d take me at my word.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With enormous satisfaction.</i>] I knew he was an Archduke all the time.
You can’t deceive a mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a start.</i>] There’s one thing I must break to you at once.
Pomerania is in some ways still a barbarous country. We have a dreadful
law that when a member of the royal family marries a foreigner not of
royal blood, his wife’s relations are prohibited from entering it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>I should like to see any one prohibit me from going to see my own
daughter.<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Jack Straw.</span></p>

<p>My dear lady, it grieves me infinitely to say it, but no sooner had you
crossed our frontier than you would be instantly beheaded.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Parker-Jennings.</span></p>

<p>Truly, sir, a barbarous country.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
